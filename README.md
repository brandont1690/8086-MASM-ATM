# 8086-MASM-ATM
An ATM system created using 8086 MASM Assembly Language, executed on DOSBox 8086 emulator.

This is my first upload to GitHub. In the first semester of my Computer Science programme, I was tasked to create someone out of Assembly Language, and I dumbly chose to create an ATM, thinking it's gonna work great. It ended up being a pretty hellish road before reaching completion.

At first, I wanted to search here, on GitHub, for some other ATMs done using assembly language for reference purposes. As it turns out all the ones I find are either ARM, x86, or use a different incompatible assembler like NASM, naive as I was at the beginning of the semester, of course, I knew nothing of that sort.

But I got gud (cough), read documentation & StackOverflow, tinkered with the registers, training arc and everything, and I finally successfully made an ATM using 8086 MASM Assembly Language, and got the highest marks in my class. Since there were barely any 8086 MASM ATM here on GitHub, I figured I should upload my completed stuff here instead.

Notes:

DOSBox 8086 emulator and MASM compiler are required for this ATM to work.
The contents of the zip file should be extracted to the same directory as the 8086 for DOSBox.
Further instructions are written in the README.TXT in the zip file.

Feel free to email me if you encounter any problem executing this code.
